To run:

qmake cloth.pro
make

./cloth


Camera controls:

Press number keys 1, 2, and 3 to switch between different scenes.

Dragging the mouse zooms in/out.
The A and D keys rotate the camera view.

Parameters:

The stiffness parameters are self-explanatory.

Cloth width changes the number of grid points along the length and width of the cloth.

Cloth Side Len changes the width of each triangle of the cloth.


In order to update cloth parameters you have to clear the scene. (Stiffnesses and time step should update automatically.)

For now the test scene just has a single piece of cloth that is anchored at one of its corners.

I have implemented stretching, shearing, bending, and damping as described in "Large Steps in Cloth Simulation" by Baraff (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/papers/sig98.pdf).

Additionally, I have implemented self-collision handling as described in Robust Treatment of Collisions, Contact, and Friction for Cloth Animation by Bridson et. al. I did not implement friction. Additionally, the collision handling I do with rigid bodies is limited. First, the rigid bodies do not move. Second, I do not perform CTCD for any of the rigid bodies against the cloth. This means that with a sufficiently large time step (or even moderately sized time steps) the cloth can penetrate the rigid bodies. Additionally, with moderate time steps the cloth can sometimes blow up when coming into contact with rigid bodies. I think the main issue is that I'm not doing any strain limiting as suggested in the Bridson paper. If I had more time, I would implement this and see if it improved the stability. It seems as though most of the time the cloth-cloth collisions perform well. I also think I improved the speed of the simulation compared to the first milestone.

To run:

qmake cloth.pro
make

./cloth


Camera controls:

Dragging the mouse zooms in/out.
The A and D keys rotate the camera view.

Parameters:

The stiffness parameters are self-explanatory.

Cloth width changes the number of grid points along the length and width of the cloth.

Cloth Side Len changes the width of each triangle of the cloth.


In order to update cloth parameters you have to clear the scene. (Stiffnesses and time step should update automatically.)

For now the test scene just has a single piece of cloth that is anchored at one of its corners.

I have implemented stretching, shearing, bending, and damping as described in "Large Steps in Cloth Simulation" by Baraff (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/papers/sig98.pdf).
